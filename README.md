# hddoff-shell-script

As the name suggest, it's a shell script to turn off all Removable Drive similar to Safely Remove Hardware in Windows.

i should also mentioned that this script WILL TRY TO EJECT YOUR SYSTEM DRIVE because i use NVMe SSD (/dev/nvmeX) instead of SATA so it will try to unmount ALL /dev/sdX.
